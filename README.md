Hi Brian, I want to tell you a little about myself.

I've spent the last 5 years working in an agency setting, building training programs for other companies. It can be less-than-rewarding, because once the project is shipped I never hear anything about it again (unless something goes wrong). I'm intruiged by the opportunity to build in-house tools.

In college I studied architecture. That's one reason I'm more aware of the user than most of my peers. It's easy to forget, but buildings have users too. That has served me well in my current role, because I tend to recognize UX issues and opportunities as I'm working, and I can work with designers to make course corrections.

Currently I work in a cross-functional team, and often I'm the only developer working on a given project. I work well with designers, writers, and clients. One of my weaknesses may be that I don't have a lot of experience working side-by-side with other programmers.

There are certainly other programmers in the company, and we get together once a month to share knowledge. In the last year I've given three presentations to that group: 

1. A high-level breakdown of Webpack
2. A system I was working on for testing views in isolation (before I knew about storybook.js.org)
3. A course that we built inside of Excel, using VBA macros.

I have a lot of experience with React, and one thing I like about it is that you spend most of your time writing plain old JavaScript. I consider my time at work to be an investment in my career, and it's always a better investment to stay close to the standards.

I would like to build tools for Amerprise in order to broaden my experience and become a better developer. Thank you for your consideration.
